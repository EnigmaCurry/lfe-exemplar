*Markup Language Expressions for LFE: creating HTML with s-expressions on the Erlang VM.*

## Introduction

### About the Name

Naming and cache invalidation, right?

The first thought was to name the project ML-expr: ML for HTML, replacing the
"s" of "s-expression". MLEXPR isn't all that pronouncable, so another "e" and
an "a" were added for "exemplar". That's all there is to is.
