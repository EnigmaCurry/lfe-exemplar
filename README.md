## Introduction [&#x219F;](#contents)

### Supported Tags [&#x219F;](#contents)

[![][html5_logo]][html5_logo]

[html5_logo]: priv/images/HTML5_Logo_tiny.png

Right now, only HTML5 is supported. Feel free to submit pull requests to support
older/different tags/elements.

The list of tags was obtained from [Mozilla's HTML 5 documentation][mz]

[mz]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list

Note that XML namespacing hasn't been explored yet, but *should* be possible.


### Current Status [&#x219F;](#contents)

As you can see in the example usage below, you can use exemplar to build HTML
strings using LFE S-expressions. However, do note that the project has *just*
started and there are lots of unexplored HTML edge-cases that simply won't work
right now.

If you come across anything, feel free to submit a bug in the github issue
tracker, or even send us a pull request :-)


### About the Name [&#x219F;](#contents)

Naming and cache invalidation, right?

The first thought was to name the project ML-expr: ML for HTML, replacing the
"s" of "s-expression". MLEXPR isn't all that pronouncable, so another "e" and
an "a" were added for "exemplar". That's all there is to it.

Also: "Do you know who I *am*?!"


## Dependencies [&#x219F;](#contents)

This project assumes that you have [rebar3](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3)
installed somwhere in your ``$PATH``.


## Installation [&#x219F;](#contents)

Just add it to your ``rebar.config`` deps:

```erlang
{deps, [
    ...
    {exemplar, ".*", {git, "git@github.com:lfex/exemplar.git", {tag, "x.y.z"}}
  ]}.
```

And then do the usual:

```bash
$ rebar3 compile
```
